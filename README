Webwork <-> Moodle wwlink Block (Bridge 1)
Maintainer: Matthew Leventi (mleventi@gmail.com)
----------------------------------------------

Description:
This creates a WeBWorK Link within the Moodle system. Note that I highly recommend that you use the WeBWorK question type (bridge 2) instead of this block. Bridge 2 is much faster and more stable.

Prerequisites:
1) An installation of WeBWorK.
2) The wwassignment module should be installed in your installation of Moodle.

Note: It does not matter which you install first, or if you install both of them at the same time, but the wwlink block and the wwassignment module must be present in your moodle installation before either of them is used.

Installation:
1) Copy the wwlink folder into the blocks directory
    ex: cp -R wwlink /your/moodle/blocks
2) Soft link the lang file in wwlink into the moodle language directory
    ex: ln -s /your/moodle/blocks/wwlink/lang.php /your/moodle/lang/en_utf8/block_wwlink.php
3) Point your browser to the moodle admin page
    ex : http://www.example.org/moodle/admin

Use:
1) In the main page of your course turn editing on.
2) Add a new WeBWorK Link block using the dropdown.
3) Edit the WeBWorK Link block.
4) Choose a course to connect to.
5) Confirm.
